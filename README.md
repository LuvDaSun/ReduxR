# ReduxR - Redux for rust
This repository provides a redux store, with some examples that show how to do redux in rust.

## Automated tests
Never commit something that breaks the build! You can easily prevent this by linking the `pre-commit` script as a git `pre-commit` hook!

like this:
```bash
ln pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit
```
